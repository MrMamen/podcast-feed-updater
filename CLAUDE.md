# Claude Instructions for this Project

## Git Commits

When creating git commits in this repository, always use Claude as the author:

```bash
git commit --author="Claude <claude@anthropic.com>" -m "commit message"
```

This helps distinguish between changes made by Claude and changes made by the repository owner.

Don't commit generated files (.xml and .json). Avoid using person names in commit messages.

Ask before commiting.
